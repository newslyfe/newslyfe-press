## 🎯 Problem & Solution

The global news stream is chaotic and unmanageable with traditional tools. NewsLyfe organizes this information flood into a focused, high-performance workspace, giving users back control. Nearly 100,000 new articles arrive daily from almost 7,000 sources—all in a single, manageable interface.

**The platform is algorithmically neutral.** We do not rank, highlight, or remove news. Display is strictly chronological; content and freshness are the responsibility of the source domains. Our goal is to provide a clean, manipulation-free tool for users.

This is a web application that brings native software functionality to the browser. Responsiveness, customization, persistence, and modularity go far beyond what a typical website offers.

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Tab-based Workspace:** Dynamically create, organize, and persist tabs—each representing a separate workflow (news feed, search, etc.).
- ✅ **Real-time Filtering & Search:** Instantly narrow results by country, language, and keywords using a filter pipeline.
- ✅ **Unified Interface:** Manage text articles and news videos from various sources on a single, clean interface.

**Highlighted stack:**
- **Frontend:** React
- **State management:** Context API, `TabController`
- **Local storage:** IndexedDB (for workspace persistence)
- **Desktop version:** Electron
- **Mobile platforms (in preparation):** iOS & Android
